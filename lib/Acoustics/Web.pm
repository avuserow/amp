=head1 NAME

Acoustics::Web - handle web requests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module handles web requests. It's designed to be indepedent of web server
and should run with regular CGI, FastCGI, mod_perl, or similar, so long as we
can get an object that looks like L<CGI> or L<CGI::Simple>.

All of the (public) methods return two values: an array reference of values to
pass to CGI's header method, and a Perl data structure to encode using
L<JSON::DWIW> or whatever module you like to send data back. The array reference
may be C<[]> instead if we don't care about the headers.

    # give me a Acoustics object and a CGI object
    my $web = Acoustics::Web::JSON->new({
        acoustics => $acoustics,
        cgi       => $cgi,
    });

    # then call a method on me.
    my($code, $data) = $web->random;
    my($code, $data) = $web->stop;
    # etc

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

new({acoustics => $acoustics, cgi => $cgi})

Takes an Acoustics object, a CGI (or compatible) object, and returns an
Acoustics::Web object. Both are required to be present when calling C<new>.

Additionally, you may pass a coderef as a C<boolean_callback> parameter. This
code will be called when a boolean should be returned. This is useful for
outputting to JSON and returning a real true or false value. By default, it uses
double-negation on the value.

=head2 _newsearch

Takes in a JSON structure and searches for things. Examples:

=over 4

=item * songs where artist is foo and album is bar

    ["artist", "==", "foo", "AND", "album", "==", "bar"]

=item * songs where artist is foo or artist is bar and album is not baz

    ["artist", "==", "foo", "OR", ["artist", "==", "bar", "album", "!=",
    "baz"]]

=back

Basically, specify a "group". This group contains either one value (a
subgroup), or three values (field, operator, and value). Then the group either
ends or has a joining operator, and the initial values repeat.

Operators, which may be prefaced with a ! to negate it: == for equals and ~~
for contains.

Joining operators are C<AND> and C<OR>.
